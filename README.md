Code for the Alexa Skill - Coronavirus Cases

I have uploaded an index.js file which basically has all the code that does teh functionality of the program. It's a web scraping program which scrapes data form the Coronavirus Worldometer website and reports that data. Do have a look at my inefficient code and suggest any improvements. I am not so advanced in Javascript or Node.js so I would appreciate help.

Things I need to work on:
1) Implementing the await function so that the data is displayed only once it's received to avoid the text being said without any values.
2) Web scraping from a table which has constantly changing values. In teh website, the values of Italy and South Korea for example were constantly changing and I had to manually change their selector path every time their positions changed otherwise it would result in the program saying unwanted phrases.
3) Making the code more space and time efficient by using loops.
4) Combining the LaunchIntent and the HelloWorldIntent together.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to view my code. And the README.
